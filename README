	1. About
	========
		kREproxy - kernel reverse proxy server is a very simple proxy
		server of http protocol which use simple configuration to decide
		where pass the http requests. kREproxy server works in linux kernel
		spaca as kernel module. This gives ability to be faster than user space's
		revers proxy solutions.                

	2. Configuration
	================
		To configure kREproxy server we have to change it code. This
		is not confortable but it's enough to start.
		Some configuration is in kre_options.h file, and kre_main.c.
		
		2.1 Configuration entry
		=======================
			Configuration entry is a pattern which kREproxy can interpret
			and bind with appropriate destination server.
			
			Example of one entry.
			URI	hostname		destination ip		dst port
			"/*"	"example.com"	=>	127.0.0.1		8080

			The above tells kREproxy that if client send simple request GET/POST like 
				GET /example HTTP/1.1
				Host: example.com
			kREproxy pass this request to the destination HTTP server like this 
				127.0.0.1:8080 host
			That is all. For this experiment it's enough.

		2.2 Default entry
		=================
			Default entry consists only of 
				*) destination ip addres 
				*) destination port
			
			Example of default entry
			URI	hostname		dst ip			dst port
			""	""		=>	192.168.0.2		80

			It's match all types of requests, and it's simple enough.

		2.3 Main configuration
		======================
			Main configuration of kREproxy consists of minimum default entry.
			In most popular case we must add some "Configuration entries" and 
			one "Default entry" in the end of config. 

			Configuration example:
			"/*" 			"example-one.com"	=> 127.0.0.1 		8080
			"/some/path"	        "example-one.com"	=> 192.168.0.2		80
			"/*"			"example-two.org"	=> 192.168.0.3		80
			"/image/*"		"image.examp.org"	=> 192.168.0.4		80
			"/video/*"		"example-two.org"	=> 192.168.0.4		80
			""			""			=> 192.168.0.10		80

			We can add configuration entries in kre_main.c file. There are some examples of
			how can you do this in kre_main.c

	3. Installation
	===============
